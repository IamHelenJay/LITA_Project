### A. Project Overview 
---
This data analysis project aims to discover the impact exposing children to cartoon characters has on their development. 

### B. Data Sources
---
The primary source of data will be a cross section of children between the ages of 1 to 10 years, living in urban areas.

### C. Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)

  1. For Data Cleaning,
  2. For Analysis and
  3. For Data Visualization.

- SQL- Structured Query Language for Quering of Data

- GitHub for Portfolio Building


### D. Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
The following steps should be followed:
1. Data Sourcing
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Validation and Interpretation.


### E. Exploratory Data Analysis
---
Now we need to answer some questions:
- At what age should children be allowed to watch cartoons?
- What amount of screen time becomes detrimental to brain growth?  
- What is the overall effect of excessive exposure to cartoon characters to the development of children 
  with the sample size?

 
 ### F. Data Analysis
 ---
 ```SQL
SELECT * FROM CHILDREN_TABLE
 CASE
   WHEN AGE BETWEEN 1 AND 10 THEN SAMPLE SIZE
 ELSE DISREGARD
END AS SAMPLE_SIZE
```

### G. Data Visualization and Table Index

|S/N|Name of Character|Gender|
|---|-----------------|------|
| 1 | Shimmer    | Female |
| 2 | Robots of Quinzela| Female|
| 3 | Dark Knight    | Male|


### H. Interpretation
1. The colours used in the creation of the cartoon characters stimulate brain activity in children.
2. It also keeps the minds of children in an explorative state and creative.
3. Educative information can also be passed to the children due to the attractive nature of these characters.
